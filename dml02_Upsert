//     - Do not have to check if a record exists
//     - Uses a records primary key, an idLookup field, or an external ID feild to determine
//       whether or not to create a new record or update an existing one.
//       	- if key is not matched, a new object record is created
//       	- if key is matched once, the existing object record is updated
//       	- if key is matched multiple times, an error is generated

// Insert the Josh contact
Contact josh = new Contact(FirstName='Josh', LastName='Kaplan', Department='Finance');
insert josh;

// The josh record has been inserted and now has an ID. This will be used to match records
// by upest

josh.Description = 'Josh\'s record has been updated by the upsert operation.';

// Create a new record but don't insert it
Contact kathy = new Contact(FirstName='Kathy', LastName='Brown', Department='Technology');

List<Contact> contacts = new List<Contact> {josh, kathy};
