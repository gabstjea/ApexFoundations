// Data Manipulation Language (DML) exercise 2.1: upsert command by id look up field
// This program demonstrates how the upsert command will refuse to update or insert 
// a contact if the ID field has multiple matches for the same ID. 
//
// The upsert command updates existing records and creates new ones within the same line

Contact jane = new Contact(FirstName='Jane',
                         LastName='Smith',
                         Email='jane.smith@example.com',
                         Description='Contact of the day');
insert jane;

// 1. Upsert using an idLookup field
// This object doesnâ€™t have any ID field because it has not yet been inserted. 
Contact jane2 = new Contact(FirstName='Jane',
                         LastName='Smith',  
                         Email='jane.smith@example.com',
                         Description='Prefers to be contacted by email.');

// Upsert the contact by using the idLookup field for matching.
// both jane and jane2 have the same email field so the command will throw an eror
upsert jane2 Contact.fields.Email;

// Verify that the contact has been updated
System.assertEquals('Prefers to be contacted by email.',
                   [SELECT Description FROM Contact WHERE Id=:jane.Id].Description);
