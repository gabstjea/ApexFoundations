// Data Manipulation Model (DML) exercise 5e1: updating related record fields
//
// This program demonstrates how a child object in a lookup.master-slave relationship can modify the fields of its parent
// and how to propely update a related field modified by its child
// In particular, in this program, A Contact record is related to an Account record. The sObject containing the Contact
// record modifies the industry field of the Account record it is related to. When updating the records, the account 
// field must be invoked by the child record.
//
// Anonymous class

// Query a Contact record and retrieve the name associated with its Account (the related record)
Contact[] contactQuery = [SELECT Account.name FROM Contact Where FirstName='Mario' AND LastName='Ruiz' LIMIT 1];
Contact firstContact = contactQuery[0];

// Display the name associated with the account
System.debug('Mario's account name ' + firstContact.Account.name);

// Modify the feilds of the record and its related record
firstContact.phone='(404)-723-1074';
firstContact.Account.Industry = 'Technology';

// Updating the Contact objects field and its related record
update contactQuery;
update contactQuery.Account;
